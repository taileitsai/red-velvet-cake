Preheat oven to 180Â°C.
Sift all dry ingredients (up to cocoa) into a bowl.
Beat Chelsea White Sugar and eggs together then incorporate all the other wet ingredients.
Combine wet and dry ingredients together until smooth, you can use a kitchen aid or an electric mixer to make it easier.
Place in a round medium sized cake tin and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes (until a toothpick inserted in middle of cake comes out clean). Let it cool completely (this may take an hour).

Icing:
While cake is cooling make up the icing.
Add all the icing ingredients together and beat until thick and creamy.
Spread on the cake -you will have to do 2 coats as the first one, the crumbs come off, then do the second one and let it set for 10min and then you can enjoy!
The cake will last for 9-10 days in an air tight container.
